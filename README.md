# Exercism Haskell Track Exercises

[Exercism.org Haskel Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/haskell)

I discovered [Exercism](exercism.org) and think it's a great tool to help me learn Haskell on my journey to becoming able to write Cardano Smart Contracts with [Plutus](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus).

What I found really intriguing about Exercism as a coding exercising platform is that it provides the option to pull the exercises and tests down to your local machine. This creates the opportunity to learn how a language and environment must be setup and run locally, while giving you something to learn programming in the new language with that is manageable. It also allows you to experiment with different tools for development in the environment which would typically not be available in a browser-based coding exercise environment.

There were some helpful steps on Exercism for setting up your Haskell environment using [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). I found [Ivan Hrekov
's article on setting up Haskell and configuring VS Code](https://betterprogramming.pub/haskell-vs-code-setup-in-2021-6267cc991551) most helpful to setup my environment in a way that I feel like I'm getting benefits from some of the tooling available.
